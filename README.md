## Developer Quiz - Project Submission
Project Overview
This project is my submission for the developer quiz, created to showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective was to build a responsive webpage based on a provided wireframe and design while adhering to the following criteria:

Use of HTML and CSS only (no frameworks like Bootstrap or page builders).
JavaScript for any additional interactivity.
This project highlights my ability to follow design specifications closely and implement the desired functionality using clean and maintainable code.


## Challenges Faced While working on this project, I encountered some challenges, which Iâ€™ve outlined below:

The burger menu has presented itself as an issue and it is not perfect as I would like but I moved on from that. 
Despite these challenges, I have done my best to ensure the solution is as close to the provided design as possible.
